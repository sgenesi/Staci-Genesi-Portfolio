                    My name is Staci Genesi and I am a newly minted web developer in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.  I am starting my web development career a little late in life after spending 10 years teaching kindergarten.  I pride myself on being a creative person.  I have excellent organization and planning skills, and I work very well with a mulitude of personalities.

                    You may be wondering why I left teaching to become a web developer.  Well, to be honest, the answer is kind of simple: COVID-19.  Teaching changed drastically for me when I went from a classroom teacher to an online teacher overnight.  In my pursuit to offer the best education I could to kindergartners online I engaged in some professional development classes.  One of these classes was on the basics of HTML code.  I took what I learned in this class and was able to change my basic district Canvas page into a more kid friendly and engaging site.  I was opened up to a world I never knew I could enjoy or see myself pursuing.  I spent some time researching and discovered that there was so much more to learn and decided to take the plunge and jump in.  I am so excited to start this new career and see where it can take me.
